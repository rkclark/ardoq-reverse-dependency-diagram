Reverse Dependency Map Plugin for Ardoq
======

An alternative version of the out-of-the-box Dependency Map visualisation available in [Ardoq](https://ardoq.com/). 

This plugin simply reverses the direction of the dependencies shown on the visualisation :) Apart from that, it works in exactly the same way as the standard version.

## Installation

- Open the Ardoq plugin editor *(Refer to Ardoq help documentation for guidance if needed)*
- Click to create a new Plugin
- Give the plugin an ID and name. The name will be shown in the visualisation list.
- Copy and paste the code from reverse-dependency.js into the code editor window, over-writing any existing code that may be there.
- Click to Save and Run the plugin. It will now be a selectable visualisation in your model!

*I hope you enjoy using the visualisation! Changes to the core Ardoq application may affect the plugin in the future, feel free to open an issue on this repo if you have any problems :)*

*Plugin working correctly as at Ardoq version Version: 3.4.60 / 1.39.16.*
